## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
w3schools.com
stackoverflow.com
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The challenge I encountered was the understanding of the flow chart to implement how the game run and randomizing the sound.
Solution:
I read line by lines to write the conditions
to randomize, I just created a function that randomize input so that I can actualize the pattern array values.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I wonder if this can become a game where a user can play versus an AI that is trained to play this game.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I will focus on the UX and expanding the game potential meaning the number of squares and using real songs to  make it interesting. I also look forward to create a multiplayer version
to allow people to challenges others and have fun together.
